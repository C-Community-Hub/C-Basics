# Exercise 1-5

Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates how one can change the initialization and the increment step in a for loop so as to print the temperature table in reverse order.

## How to Run
```bash
gcc solution.c -o solution
./solution
```

## Expected Output
A Celsius-Fahrenheit table will be printed in the reverse order
